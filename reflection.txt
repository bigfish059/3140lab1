We have followed almost same program logic in case of both of the codes, but in JAVA there were many predefined classes available for performing the operations.We had imported 5 packages in total for java but none for bash script We have followed almost same program logic in case of both of the codes, but in JAVA there were many predefined classes available for performing the operations. As part of this lab, I wrote programs in Java and Bash that would accept two dates as input and print the number of days that separate them. I import the Java time library and Java scanner library in order to use Java. I need the time library in my software so that I can store dates as values and perform calculations on them. The user's input can only be obtained through the scanner library; without a scanner, this is not possible. The majority of Java programs require a library. Contrarily, a bash script may execute the majority of a program on its own.
