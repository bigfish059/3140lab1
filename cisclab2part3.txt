For the group project, we worked  group of three people. When working on the project, we collaborate via meeting over Zoom. We all looked at the datasets we wanted to do individually during our first meeting and then shared the datasets with each other to choose a single dataset we wanted to utilize for the project. We're use dataset that includes information on automobile accidents in New York City. Then, we come up with five questions that we believe are the most straightforward to deal with and can be answered with the dataset. On the second day of our meeting, we share our screen with the other members of the group and begin writing the first awk program that will respond to our first question.
We first struggled to answer the first question since we are unfamiliar with awk. However, after going through the GNU Awk Manual and doing some internet study, we were able to create our first program. The second question presents a challenge since some of the results doesn't match what we had anticipated. After much trial and error, we finally identify the issue as the dataset's format. At first, we are utilizing a CSV file, which uses a comma as the field separator. The comma in one of the columns in our dataset, however, causes part of the data to be in the incorrect place. There is no issue while working with the remaining questions because we essentially utilize the same coding as the first question.
